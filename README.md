# Maggie Suero Website
 This repo describes the process of making my personal website 

1) I downloaded a template from https://colorlib.com/wp/template/meetme/
2) I uploaded the unmodified template to the repo
3) I started removing the parts of the template that I wasn't going to use
4) I started adding my personal data
